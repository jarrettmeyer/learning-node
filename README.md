# Just me, learning NodeJS

My little lessons to myself are written in [Coffee Script](http://coffeescript.org). If you haven't, please make sure to install `coffee-script` yourself.

    $ npm install -g coffee-script
    $ coffee file.coffee

To run Sample App #1...

    $ cd ./sample_app_1
    $ coffee server.coffee

To stop the sample app, use `CTRL-c`.
Thanks!
